# cv
This repository contains my cv, currently only in [german](https://github.com/MartinHinz/cv/blob/master/cv_german.md).

Additionally it contains the [css](https://github.com/MartinHinz/cv/blob/master/css.css) for rendering the cv using pandoc. This CSS is derived from [elipapa/markdown-cv](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv).
